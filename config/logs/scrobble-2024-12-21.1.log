MS is likely being run in a container with BRIDGE networking which means the above addresses are not accessible from outside this container.
To ensure the container is accessible make sure you have mapped the *container* port 9078 to a *host* port. https://foxxmd.github.io/multi-scrobbler/docs/installation#networking
The container will then be accessible at http://HOST_MACHINE_IP:HOST_PORT (or https://multiscrobbler.c3r5b8.dev/ since you defined this!)
